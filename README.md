# lisk-dex-ui

## How to run

1. Clone repository.
2. `cd lisk-dex-electron && npm i`
3. `npm run start`
4. Leaving the last process running, `npm run electron`.

This setup allows Electron to hot-reload from a web server, making development much more convenient; And, we can still produce a bundled app that works offline.

Alternatively, you can view the running application at http://localhost:3000/
